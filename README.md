Bricks
======

*Bricks* is a hybrid Object Builder/Factory implementation. It aims to be a more flexible alternative to the existing Object Factory solutions while remaining as simple as possible.

Usage
-----

We'll use the following domain to describe *Brick's* features:

    # Only ActiveRecord objects are supported right now.

    # == Schema Information
    #
    # Table name: articles
    #
    #  id              :integer(4)      not null, primary key
    #  title           :string(255)
    #  author          :string(255)
    #  formatted_title :string(510)
    #  popularity      :integer(4)
    #  publication_id  :integer(4)
    #
    class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :publication
      has_many   :readers
    end

    # == Schema Information
    #
    # Table name: publications
    #
    #  id   :integer(4)      not null, primary key
    #  name :string(255)
    #  type :string(255)
    #
    class Publication < ActiveRecord::Base
    end

    class Newspaper < Publication
    end

    # == Schema Information
    #
    # Table name: readers
    #
    #  id         :integer(4)      not null, primary key
    #  name       :string(255)
    #  birth_date :date
    #
    class Reader < ActiveRecord::Base
    end

At its simplest, you can start using *Bricks* without declaring any builder (*note:* it gets less verbose).

    article_builder = build(Article)

This will give you a builder for the Article class, which you can then use to build an Article

    article_builder.
      title("Why I hate Guybrush Threepwood").
      author("Ghost Pirate LeChuck")

Contrary to the original pattern, builders are stateful (i.e., you don't get a new builder every time you call a method on the current builder).

You can get the underlying instance by calling `#generate`.

    article = article_builder.generate

This will initialize an Article with the attributes you passed the builder. If, instead of initializing, you'd prefer the record to be created right away, use `#create` instead.

If you don't really care about the builder and just want the underlying instance you can instead use.

    article = build(Article).
      title("Why I hate Guybrush Threepwood").
      author!("Ghost Pirate LeChuck") # Note the "!"

When you want to use the default builder, without customizing it any further, you can tack the "!" at the end of the builder method:

    build!(Article)
    create!(Article)

### Building builders

Of course, using builders like described above isn't of much use. Let's create a builder for `Article`:

    Bricks do
      builder Article do
        title  "Why I hate Guybrush Threepwood"
        author "Ghost Pirate LeChuck"
      end
    end

You can then use it as you'd expect:

    # initializes an Article with default attributes set, and saves it
    article = create!(Article)

### Deferred initialization

    builder Article do
      # ...

      formatted_title { "The formatted title at #{Date.now}." }
    end

You can get at the underlying instance from deferred blocks:

    builder Article do
      # ...

      formatted_title { |obj| obj.title + " by " + obj.author }
    end

### Associations

*Bricks* supports setting association records.

#### Many-to-one (belongs to)

    Bricks do
      builder Publication do
        name "The Caribbean Times"
      end

      builder Article do
        # ...

        publication # instantiate a publication with the default attributes set
      end
    end

You can also customize the association builder instance:

    builder Article do
      # ...
      publication.name("The Caribeaneer")
    end

If you prepend a "~" to the association declaration, the record will be initialized/created *only* if a record with the given attributes doesn't exist yet:

    builder Article do
      # ...
      ~publication # will search for a record with name "The Caribbean Times"
    end

The same effect can be achieved in your tests using

    ~(build(Publication)).name!("The Daily Bugle")

but since this is ugly, you can just use `?` instead of `!` and you'll get (almost) the same effect:

    build(Publication).name?("The Daily Bugle")

There is a slight difference between using `~` and `?`. `~` will permanently change the builder, while `?` will enable searching only when it's used.

#### One-to-many, Many-to-many (has many, has and belongs to many)

You can create several objects for a *-to-many association by calling the method `#build` on the association:

    builder Article do
      # readers association will have 3 records
      3.times { readers.build }
    end

Upon generation, this will add 3 records with their attributes set to the defaults defined in the association class' builder. 

If you want to further customize each builder in the association, you can omit the `#build` method call:

    builder Article do
      # ...

      # readers association will have 3 records
      %w(Tom Dick Harry).each { |r| readers.name(r) }
    end

Each call to the *-to-many association name will add a new builder, which you can then further customize:

    readers.name("Tom").birth_date(30.years.ago)

(Note that you don't use "!" here. That's only when building the records in your tests.)

### Passing the parent to association builder blocks

If you need access to the parent object when building an associated object, you'll find it as the second argument passed to a deferred block.

    builder Article do
      # ...

      publication.name { |_, article| "#{article.title}'s publication" }
    end

### Builder Inheritance

Given the builder:

    builder Publication do
      name "The Caribbean Times"
    end

you can do something like:

    np = build!(Newspaper)
    np.class # => Newspaper
    np.name  # => "The Caribbean Times"

### Traits

The real power of the Builder pattern comes from the use of traits. Instead of declaring name factories in a single-inheritance model, you instead declare traits, which you can then mix and match:

    builder Article
      # ...

      trait :alternative_publication do |name|
        publication.name(name)
      end

      trait :by_elaine do
        title  "Why I love Guybrush Threepwood"
        author "Elaine Marley-Threepwood"
      end
    end

Use it like this:

    article = build(Article).alternative_publication("The Caribeaneer").by_elaine!

Note that if you want to override a *-to-many association inside a trait, you need to clear it first:

    builder Article
      # ...

      # this will reset the readers association
      trait :new_readers do
        readers.clear

        %(Charlotte Emily Anne).each { |r| readers.name(r) }
      end

      # this will add to the readers association
      trait :more_readers do
        readers.name("Groucho")
      end
    end

For an executable version of this documentation, please see spec/bricks_spec.rb.

### Hooks

*Bricks includes a simple, general hook framework. It allows you to do something like this:

    builder Article
      # ...

      trait :on_the_bugle do
        publication.name "The Daily Bugle"
        popularity       75
      end

      trait :on_the_planet do
        publication.name "The Daily Planet"
        popularity       85
      end

      after :clone do
        send %w(on_the_bugle on_the_planet)[rand(2)]
      end

      before :save do
        active true
      end
    end

*Bricks* supports only two hooks right now: after(:clone) and before(:save).

The after(:clone) hook will be executed whenever you use any of #build, #build!, #create or #create!, right before you start customizing the resulting builder on your test.

On the other hand, the before(:save) hook will be executed only for #create and #create!.

Installation
------------

### Rails 2

Add `config.gem "bricks"` to `environments/test.rb` or, as a rails plugin:

    $ script/plugin install git://github.com/mojotech/bricks.git # Rails 2

### Rails 3

Add `gem "bricks"` to your `Gemfile`, or, as a rails plugin:

    $ rails plugin install git://github.com/mojotech/bricks.git # Rails 3

### RSpec [TODO: add instructions for other frameworks]

    # you only need to add the following line if you're using the gem
    require 'bricks/adapters/active_record'

    # put this inside RSpec's configure block to get access to
    # #build, #build!, #create and #create! in your specs
    config.include Bricks::DSL

Finally, add a file to spec/support containing your builders. Call it whatever you'd like and make sure it gets loaded (rspec usually loads all .rb files under spec/support).
